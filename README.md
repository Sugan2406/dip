# Face-mask-detection
COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly affected our day-to-day life-disrupting world trade and movements.
Wearing a protective face mask has become a new normal. In the near future, many public service
providers will ask the customers to wear masks correctly to avail of their services. Therefore, face mask
detection has become a crucial task to help global society. Sectors such as infrastructure construction
and maintenance projects have not been suspended due to their significant effect on people's routine
life. In such projects, workers work close together that makes a high risk of infection. The World Health
Organization recommends wearing a face mask and practicing physical distancing to mitigate the virus's
spread. This paper developed a computer vision system to automatically detect the violation of face
mask-wearing and physical distancing among construction workers to assure their safety on
infrastructure projects during the pandemic. For the face mask detection, collected and annotated 1,000
images, including different types of face mask-wearing, and added them to a pre-existing face mask
dataset to develop a dataset of 1,853 images. Then trained and tested multiple TensorFlow
state-of-the-art object detection models on the face mask dataset and chose the Mobile Net V2 yielded
the accuracy of 95% and 88% and the second model Faster R-CNN Inception ResNet V2 used for testing
the entire dataset network that yielded the accuracy of 99%.
